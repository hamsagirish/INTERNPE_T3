TO-DO LIST APP
I am excited to share my recent project, a TO-DO app, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This app enables users to efficiently manage their tasks, offering functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as marking them as completed. 
The sleek and intuitive user interface, crafted with CSS, ensures a seamless user experience, while JavaScript powers the app's interactivity and dynamic features.
